for b) objects.pgm ,parameter sigma=0.5 T1=0.7 T2=0.85 is chosen
for c) pruebab1.pgm,prameter sigma=9 T1=0.7 T2=0.8 is chosen

b)has more clear edge and less noise,so a relative low sigma is chosen.
c)has less clear edge and much higher noise,a high value of sigma is chosen to smooth the image and filter out the noise.Threshold value can be lower a little bit to avoid the loss of edge while filting the noise.
