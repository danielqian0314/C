Problem 3
b.8*8DCT spectra  consists of small blocks of spectra. 8*8DCT is much more faster than DCT on whole image.
c.The low frequency area of spectra is all black(zero).The backtransformed image of 8*8 DCT have better quality.
d.the quantisation strategies using JPEG weighting matrix give better result 

Problem 5
b.gamma should have the value near 0.4 to give reasonalbe results
